## Introduction

This project aims to analyze and visualize Amazon sales data to derive meaningful insights. We've used three primary tools to achieve this: Python for data processing, SQL for database management, and Power BI for creating interactive dashboards and reports.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- **Python Scripts:** Contains Python scripts for analysis, and visualization.
- **SQL Queries:** Includes SQL queries used to extract, transform, and load (ETL) the data.
- **Power BI Reports:** Contains Power BI report files for visualizing and exploring the data.
- **Data:** This folder stores the raw and processed data used in the analysis.

## Tools Used

### Python

Python is used for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization. I've used libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for data processing and visualization.

### SQL

SQL is used to manage the dataset, perform queries, and extract data for analysis. We've used SQL Server in this project.

### Power BI

Power BI is employed for creating interactive dashboards and reports. It allows for a user-friendly exploration of the data.
